Assume that a program contains the following declarations:

char c = '\1';
short s = 2;
int i = -3;
long m = 5;
float f = 6.5f;
double d = 7.5;

give the value and type of each expression listed below


(a) c * i = -3, type int
(b) s + m = 7, type long
(c) f / c = 6.5f, type float
(d) d / s = 3.75, type double
(e) f - d = -1.0, type double
(f) (int) f = 6, type int
