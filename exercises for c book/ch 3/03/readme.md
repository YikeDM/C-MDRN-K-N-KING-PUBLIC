"%d" and " %d" are equal because white space is skipped,

"%d-%d-%d" is equal to "%d -%d -%d" due to the white space being before the "-" 

"%f" and "%f " are equal as white space ignored

"%f,%f" and "%f, %f" are not equal as the white space after a non white space character terminates the scanf call
