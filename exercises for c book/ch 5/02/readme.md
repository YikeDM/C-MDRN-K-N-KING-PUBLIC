The following program fragments illustrate the logicaloperators.
Show the output produced by each, assuming that i,j, and k are int variables.

(a) i = 10, j = 5;
    printf("%d", !i < j);

    The output would be: "1"

(b) i = 2, j = 1;
    printf("%d", !!i + !j)

    The output would be: "1"

(c) i = 5, j = 0, k = -5;
    printf("%d", i && j | | k);

    The output would be: "1"

(d) i = 1, j = 2, k = 3;
    printf("%d", i < j | | k);

    The output would be: "1"
