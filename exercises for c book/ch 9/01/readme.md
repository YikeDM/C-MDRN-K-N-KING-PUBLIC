Hie following function, which computes the area of a triangle, contains two errors. Locate
the errors and show how to fix them. {Hint: There are no errors in the formula.)


double triangle_area(double base, height)
double product;
{
product = base * height;
return product / 2;
}

double product should be inside the function.
height has no type specified.
