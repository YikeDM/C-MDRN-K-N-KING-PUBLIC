Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
assuming that the loop bodies are the same

(a) while (1 < 10) {...}

(b) for (; i < 10; ) {...}

(c) do {...} while (i < 10);

C is not equivalent, as do will always execute the loop once, 
therefore if i is greater or equal to 10 the do loop will still execute one time.
