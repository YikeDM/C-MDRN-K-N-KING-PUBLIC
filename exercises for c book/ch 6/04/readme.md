Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
assuming that the loop bodies are the same

(a) for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)

(b) for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)

(c) for (i = 0; i++ < 10; )

C is not equivalent to the others, as i is increased as its tested
therefor if you were to print i,

a & b would start with 0 and end at 9

c would start with 1 and end at 10
