Show the output of each of the following program fragments--

-- i = 5; j = 3;
printf("%d %d", i / j, i % j);

the result would be "1 2"

-- i = 2; j = 3;
printf("%d", (i + 10) % j);

The result would be "0" // as 12 / 3 = 4 with r of 0 

-- i = 7; j = 8; k = 9;
printf("%d", (i + 10) % k / j)

The result would be "1" as ((i +10) % k) = 8, k / j = 1

-- i = 1; j = 2; k = 3;
printf("%d", (i + 5) % (j + 2) / k);

The result would be "0", as 6 / 4 = r2 / 3 = 0
